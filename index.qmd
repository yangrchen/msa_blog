# Hiya, I'm Yang!

I'm a data science Master's student who's passionate about AI, deep learning, and explainable data science. This is an open repository of notes, projects, and musings that I am gathering through my Master's at the [Institute for Advanced Analytics](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/).

I'm excited to share what I learn and hope you can join me for the ride! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yangrchen/), [Github](https://github.com/yangrchen) or through my [main website](https://yangrchen.com)
