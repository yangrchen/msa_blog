It takes on a value in the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nA **sample space** is a collection of all possible outcomes in a random process. The sum of all probabilities in the sample space must sum to 1.\n\nAn **event** is a collection of one or more outcomes from a process whose result cannot be predicted. The probability of event $X$ is expressed as $P(X)$\n\n## Basic Relationships\n\n### Complement\n\nEvent consisting of all sample points that are not in $A$.\n\n$$\nP(\\bar{A}) = 1 - P(A)\n$$\n\n### Union\n\nThe union of an event $A$ and event $B$ is the event containing all sample points in $A$ or $B$ or both.\n\n$$\nA \\cup B\n$$\n\n### Intersection\n\nAll sample points that are in **both** $A$ and $B$.\n\n$$\nA \\cap B\n$$\n\n### Addition Law\n\n$$\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\n$$\n\n### Mutually Exclusive\n\nMutually exclusive meants that events have no sample points in common--they do not intersect.\n\nThe events cannot both occur which turns the addition law into\n\n$$\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\n$$\n\n### Conditional Properties\n\nProbability of an event given that another event has occurred.\n\n$$\nP(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\n### Multiplication Law\n\nWe derive this from the conditional property which expresses the intersection as a multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nP(A \\cap B) &= P(A | B) \\cdot P(B) \\\\\n&= P(B | A) \\cdot P(A)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nIf events are independent then this becomes\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\n$$\n\n# Independent and Dependent Events\n\nAn **independent event** means that the occurrence of one event doesn't influence the probability of the other.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nP(A | B) &= P(A) \\\\\nP(B | A) &= P(B)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n-   Event B has no bearing on the occurence of event A and vice versa\n\n## Conditional vs. Marginal Probabilities\n\n**Marginal probabilities** are considered unconditional probabilities--they are probabilities of events without any condition.\n\n### Example\n\n> Let's take a look at promotion of people at a company with advanced degrees vs. those who don't have them.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\nd = {'yes': {'promoted': 288, 'not_promoted': 672},\n     'no': {'promoted': 36, 'not_promoted': 204}}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\ndf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>yes</th>\n      <th>no</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>promoted</th>\n      <td>288</td>\n      <td>36</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>not_promoted</th>\n      <td>672</td>\n      <td>204</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne marginal probability is the probability of an advanced degree:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprob_adv_deg = df['yes'].sum() / (df['yes'].sum() + df['no'].sum())\nprob_adv_deg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\n0.8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOn the other hand, a conditional probability might be the probability of a promotion given that the employee has no advanced degree:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncond_prob = df.loc['promoted', 'no'] / df['no'].sum()\ncond_prob\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\n0.15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Distributions\n\n",
