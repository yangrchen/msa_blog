These are also called:\n\n-   Attributes\n-   Features\n-   Predictors/Targets\n-   Factors\n-   Inputs/Outputs\n-   Covariates\n\n## Quantiative Variables \n\nQuantitative variables have a quantity value associated with them. These are intervals, numerics or ratios.\n\n-   Time\n-   Temperature\n-   Price\n\n## Categorical Variables \n\nCategorical variables are inherently described by categories instead of quantities.\n\nThere are two types of categorical variables:\n\n-   Nominal\n    -   Soda, Milk, Tea\n-   Ordinal\n    -   Have logical orderings associated with them\n    -   Small, Medium, Large\n\nWith ordinal variables, you can treat them as either nominal or quantitative. You have to make the decision.\n\nCategorical Dummy Variables:\n\nSmall | Medium | Large\n| :-: | :-: | :-:\n1 | 0 | 0\n0 | 1 | 0\n0 | 0 | 1\n\nThe levels are given values if treated quantitatively:\n\nSize | Size\n:-: | :-:\nS | 1\nM | 2\nL | 3\n\nIn addition, we also could do **optimal scaling** to represent the scale of the ordinal variables. This requires a careful definition of a \"1-unit\" change in the variable.\n\nEducation | Education\n:-: | :-:\nNo HS degree | 1\nGED | 2\nHS Diploma | 3\nBachelors | 10\nMasters | 16\nPhD | 20\n\n# Describing Distributions\n\n-   Center/Location\n-   Spread/Variation\n-   Shape\n-   Anomalous Observations\n\n## Measures of Central Tendency\n\n### Mean\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n$$\n\n### Median\n\nMiddle value. 50th percentile. Unaffected by outliers. In a right-skew, median is lower than the mean. In a left-skew, median is higher than the mean.\n\n### Mode\n\nMost frequent value. Typical for categorical data\n\n## Measures of Location\n\n**Percentiles** are a point, $x_p$, in your data for which $p\\%$ of the data is $\\leq x_p$.\n\n**Quantiles** are the same thing as percentiles. The 10th percentile is the 0.10 quantile.\n\n## Measures of Spread/Dispersion\n\n**Range** is $\\text{max}(data) - \\text{min}(data)$\n\n### Interquartile Range\n\nIQR is the difference between third and first quartile. What is the range of the middle 50% of data.\n\n### Variance $\\sigma^2$ and Standard Deviation \\sigma\n\nDispersion of the data around the mean. Average squared deviation from the mean. \n\n$$\ns^2 = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n$$\n\n-   The $n - 1$ comes from the degrees of freedom. In theory this will make this an unbiased estimator of the variance.\n\n## Measure of Shape\n\n### Modality\n\nModality is the number of humps a distribution has. A Normal distribution is unimodal.\n\n### Skew\n\nIs the distribution symmetric? Or does it have a longer tail on one side? \n\n![Left-skew and Right-skew](images/skew.png)\n\n### Kurtosis\n\nDoes the distribution have thicker/thinner tails than a Normal distribution with same mean and variance?\n\nA **leptokurtic** distribution has more data in the tails than a Normal distribution.\n\nA **platykurtic** distribution has less data in the tails than a Normal distribution.\n\nThis only makes sense if you have a symmetric distribution.\n\n## The Normal Distribution\n\nA Normal distribution is a distribution that is\n\n-   Symmetric\n-   Fully defined by the mean and standard deviation\n-   Bell-shaped / Unimodal\n-   Mean = Median = Mode\n-   Asymptotic to the x-axis (bounds are $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$)\n-   Kurtosis = 3 (kurtosis often reported as *excess* kurtosis = kurtosis - 3)\n-   Skew = 0 (there is no skew)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100)\n\nmean = 0\nsd = 1\n\ny = norm.pdf(x, mean, sd)\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Describing Distributions Part II\n\nUsing the **Ames Real Estate Data Set**, we want to try to predict housing sales prices in Iowa.

Normal. \n\nCompare observed quantiles to theoretical quantiles of a Normal distribution with the same mean and variance.\n\nIf the points follow the line diagonal line, the distribution is Normal.\n\n![QQ-Plot Problem Indicators](images/qq-plot-problems.png)\n\n-   Quadratic patterns indicate problems with skew\n-   Cubic patterns indicate problems with kurtosis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ames, aes(sample = Sale_Price / 1000)) +\n    stat_qq() +\n    stat_qq_line() +\n    labs(x = \"theoretical\", y = \"observed\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Box Plots\n\n![Box Plot](images/box-plot.png)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ames, aes(y = Sale_Price / 1000, x = Central_Air, fill = Central_Air)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(y = \"Sales Price (Thousands $)\", x = \"Central Air\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Accent\") +\n    theme_classic() +\n    coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Defining Anomalous Observations\n\n### Standard Deviations from the Mean\n\nFor symmetric distributions and particularly for the Normal distribution, it's common to consider observations more than 3 standard deviations from the mean as anomalous.\n\n### Box-Plot Definition\n\nBox plots define outliers as poitns that are $1.5 \\times IQR$ above the third quartile or less than $1.5 \\times IQR$ below the first quartile.\n\nThere are more definitions but these are the first couple we are considering now.",
