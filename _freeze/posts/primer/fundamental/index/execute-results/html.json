Statistics are computed from the *sample* and they are estimating population parameters (**point estimates**).\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n    A[Population] --> B[Sample]\n    B --> C[Statistic]\n    C --> D[Parameter]\n    D --> A\n```\n\n\n# Sampling Techniques\n\n We need good sampling for good estimates and in sampling we incur **bias**.\n \n Bias is when certain outcomes are favored over other outcomes in samples.\n\n## Common Types of Bias\n\n-   Selection Bias\n    -   Undercoverage: frame and population are not equal\n    -   Nonresponse: subject in sample cannot / will not respond or be measured\n-   Sampling Bias\n    -   Convenience Sampling: selecting subjects based on accessibility and ease\n    -   Voluntary sampling: subjects volunteer themselves--may not be representative\n\n## Common Sampling Techniques\n\n### Simple Random Sampling (SRS)\n\nSample items from population such that every possible sample of specified sizes has an equal chance of being selected\n\n![Simple Random Sampling](images/simple-random-sampling.png)\n\n**Advantages**\n\n-   No statistical bias\n-   No prev. info about sample needed ahead of time\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n-   Expensive\n-   Hard to implement\n-   Need list of population\n\n### Stratified Random Sampling (STS)\n\nPopulation is divided into subgroups, called **strata**, so that each member in the population belongs to only one strata.\n\n**Sample items from every strata**. The sample size between groups does not need to be the same (e.g. if we know groups in pop. are in a 20:80 ratio)\n\n![Stratified Random Sampling](images/stratified-random-sampling.png)\n\n**Advantages**\n\n-   Smaller sample sizes can achieve same accuracy as SRS\n-   More info about parts of population\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n-   Need info about population ahead of time to split on\n\n### Cluster Sampling\n\nSimilar to stratified where you group members of population into subgroups called **clusters**. You only talk to **a sample of $m$ clusters selected randomly**.\n\nIn cluster sampling, you don't necessarily believe there are differences between clusters.\n\n![Cluster Sampling](images/cluster-sampling.png)\n\n**Advantages**\n\n-   Overcome issues with travel, time, expense\n-   Easier to implement than SRS or STS\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n-   Need info about population ahead of time to split on--but not total list.\n-   May have slight bias if random clusters aren't representative\n\n### Systematic Sampling\n\nSelect every $k^{th}$ item in the populatino after randomly selecting a starting point between 1 and $k$.\n\n$k$ is determined as a ratio of population size over desired sample size.\n\n![Systematic Sampling Starting Point Selection](images/systematic-sampling-starting-point.png)\n\n![Systematic Sampling](images/systematic-sampling.png)\n\n**Advantages**\n\n-   Very easy to get sample\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\n-   May be biased especialy if order of list of population matters\n\n## Example\n\n> A large worldwide financial company wnats to develop a new retirement plan for the company. They want to survey different managers of branches around the world to find out the most important strategies the new retirement plan should contain. They have 5000 branches worldwide and want to personally interview these branch managers. They have information about the banch size (small, medium, large) and the state/province location of the branch. They want to talk to 50 branch managers. \n>\n> **Develop four separate strategies to sample these branch managers based on the four different statistical sampling techniques discussed previously.**\n\n1.  SRS: Randomly sample 50 branches to interview the managers of\n2.  STS: Stratify by size and select random samples from every strata\n3.  Cluster: Randomly select sample of states/provinces, then select branches at random from those states/provinces\n4.  Systematic: Select every 100th branch in list of branches starting from a random starting point between 1 and 100\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Example of systematic sampling in Python\n\nimport numpy as np\nindexes = np.arange(5000)\nsample_size = 50\nk = len(indexes) // sample_size\n\nprint(f'k: {k}')\nprint(f'Sample Size: {sample_size}')\n\nstart = np.random.randint(k + 1)\nselected = indexes[start::k]\n\nprint(f'Length of selected: {len(selected)}')\nindexes[start::k]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nk: 100\nSample Size: 50\nLength of selected: 50\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=6}\n```\narray([   5,  105,  205,  305,  405,  505,  605,  705,  805,  905, 1005,\n       1105, 1205, 1305, 1405, 1505, 1605, 1705, 1805, 1905, 2005, 2105,\n       2205, 2305, 2405, 2505, 2605, 2705, 2805, 2905, 3005, 3105, 3205,\n       3305, 3405, 3505, 3605, 3705, 3805, 3905, 4005, 4105, 4205, 4305,\n       4405, 4505, 4605, 4705, 4805, 4905])\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Types of Data\n\n## Qualitative vs. Quantitative\n\n**Quantitative data** are numeric data that define value of quantity.\n\n**Qualitative data** are data whose measurement scale is inherently categorical.\n\n-   Nominal data are categories with no logical ordering\n-   Ordinal data are categories with a logical order / only two ways to order the categories (binary *is* ordinal)\n\n## Time Series vs. Cross-sectional\n\n**Time series** is a set of ordered data values observed at successive point in times. Each row might be indexed by time referring to a dependence in time.\n\n**Cross-sectional** is a set of data values observed at a fixed point in time or where time is of no significance (could have time as a variable just that the response does not depend on it).\n\n",
