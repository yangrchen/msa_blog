# Hypothesis Testing Example

According to the CLT, the the mean has a sampling distribution that follows a Normal distribution as long as the sample size is large enough.

Let's take the average age of our customers as an example. Initially, we believe that the average age of our customers is $\mu = 25$ years old with standard deviation $\sigma = 10$.

We sample 100 customers and collect their age.

```{python}
# | code-fold: true

from scipy.stats import t
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mean = 25
sd = 1
alpha = 0.05

x = np.linspace(20, 35, 1000)

crit_value = norm.ppf(1 - alpha / 2, loc=mean, scale=sd)
pdf = norm.pdf(x, loc=mean, scale=sd)
plt.axvline(31, color='r')

plt.plot(x, pdf)
```

What is the probability we see a sample mean $\bar{x} = 31$ under our original assumption that the mean is 25?

It's very low! $< 0.0001$ so we have to strongly question our original hypothesis. We may no longer think it is true given the data.

# Hypothesis Testing General Framework

1.  Develop your hypothesis statements ($H_0, H_a$)
2.  Collect data for your test statistic
3.  What is the probability this happens? (P-Value)
4.  Decision about null hypothesis
5.  Summarize

# Null and Alternative Hypothesis

Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether a statement about the value of a population parameter should or should not be rejected.

-   The **null hypothesis**, $H_0$, is a tentative assumption about a population parameter. In the previous example this was $\mu = 25$
-   The **alternative hypothesis**, $H_a$, is the opposite of what is stated in the null hypothesis
-   The context of situation is important in determining how the hypotheses should be stated
-   Typically, alternative is what we are trying to test and want evidence for. Think of the null as the status quo or initial claim about our data

General Forms:

$$
H_0: \mu \leq \mu_0 \hspace{1cm} H_a: \mu > \mu_0
$$

$$
H_0: \mu \geq \mu_0 \hspace{1cm} H_a: \mu < \mu_0
$$

$$
H_0: \mu = \mu_0 \hspace{1cm} H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0
$$

The first two general forms are **one-sided tests** while the last is a **two-sided test**.

![Reject Regions](images/rejection_regions.png)

When we have probabilities in the rejection region, we are no longer confident that our null hypothesis suffices. We are led to reject the null hypothesis at a certain confidence level that we have chosen.

# Test Statistic

$$
\text{Test Statistic} = \frac{\text{Statistic} - \text{Null Value}}{\text{Std. Error}}
$$

For sample means, we need the t-distribution due the unknown values of the population standard deviation:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})}
$$

For sample proportions, we use the normal distribution:

$$
z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}
$$

# P-Values

After calculating the test statistic, we calculate the probability that we got the information we did from our sample, **assuming that our null hypothesis is true**.

**P-value** is the probability we got our sample, or a sample more extreme, under the null hypothesis.

If p-value is low, it implies our sample from the population is extremely rare if we assume that null hypothesis is true. We are led to question the validity of the null hypothesis.

# Significance Level

When we do a hypothesis test we select a significance level, $\alpha$, such that if the p-value is less than or equal to $\alpha$ the value of the test statistic is in our rejection region.


```{python}
# | code-fold: true

mean = 0
sd = 1
alpha = 0.05

x_start = mean - 4 * sd
x_end = mean + 4 * sd
step = 0.01

x = np.arange(x_start, x_end, step)
y = norm.pdf(x, mean, sd)
crit_value = norm.ppf(1 - alpha / 2, loc=mean, scale=sd)
y_crit = norm.pdf(crit_value, mean, sd)

plt.fill_between(x, y, where=y < y_crit, alpha=0.3)
plt.fill_between(x, y, where=x < -2.25)
plt.axvline(-2.25)
plt.text(-2.2, 0, 't-value')
plt.plot(x, y)
```

-   Reject $H_0$ if p-value $\leq \alpha$

# Errors in Hypothesis Test

Hypothesis tests depend on sample data therefore they may not necessarily be accurate.

## Type I Error

-   Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis was actually true (False rejection)
-   Probability of making a Type I error in a hypothesis test is called the **significance level**

## Type II Error

-   Accepting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis was actually false (False acceptance)
-   Probability of *not* making a Type II error in a hypothesis test is called the **power**
-   Difficult to control Type II error
-   Can only control for Type I or Type II at a time

# Test for Means (One Tailed Example)

> You work for a business school as an analyst.
>
> The dean of the business school just went on record saying that students who just graduated **average** at least $3000 per month in salary.
>
> With a significance level of 0.05, conduct a hypothesis test on this claim.

$$
H_0: \mu \geq 3000
$$

$$
H_a: \mu < 3000
$$

Sample data: $\bar{x} = 2940, s = 165.7$

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}})} = \frac{2940 - 3000}{(\frac{165.7}{\sqrt{12}})} = -1.25
$$


```{python}
t_value = -1.25

t.cdf(t_value, 11)
```

Since the p-value $> \alpha$ we do not reject the null hypothesis.

# Hypothesis Tests vs. Confidence Intervals

Under certain conditions, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are conducting the same test.

```{python}
# | code-fold: true
# | fig-cap: Reject $H_0$

mean = 0
sd = 1
alpha = 0.05

mean_sample = 4
sd_sample = 1

x_start = mean - 6 * sd
x_end = mean + 6 * sd
x_sample_start = mean_sample - 6 * sd_sample
x_sample_end = mean_sample + 6 * sd_sample
step = 0.01

x = np.arange(x_start, x_end, step)
y = norm.pdf(x, mean, sd)
crit_value = norm.ppf(1 - alpha / 2, loc=mean, scale=sd)
y_crit = norm.pdf(crit_value, mean, sd)

x_sample = np.arange(x_sample_start, x_sample_end, step)
y_sample = norm.pdf(x_sample, mean_sample, sd_sample)
sample_crit_value = norm.ppf(1 - alpha / 2, loc=mean_sample, scale=sd_sample)
y_crit_sample = norm.pdf(sample_crit_value, mean_sample, sd_sample)

plt.fill_between(x, y, where=y < y_crit, alpha=0.3)
plt.fill_between(x_sample, y_sample, where=y_sample > y_crit_sample, alpha=0.3)
plt.axvline(mean)
plt.axvline(mean_sample, color='r', linestyle='--')

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.plot(x_sample, y_sample)
```

-   If confidence interval around $\bar{x}$ doesn't contain the null hypothesis $\mu_0$ then we do reject $H_0$ as $\bar{x}$ is in rejection region

## Conditions

1.  The hypothesis test is two-sided
2.  $C = 1 - \alpha$ where $C$ is the confidence level and $\alpha$ is the significance level
