```{python}
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
```

```{python}
bike = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IAA-Faculty/statistical_foundations/master/bike.csv')
bike.head()
```

# 1

```{python}
bike_lm = smf.ols('cnt ~ C(workingday) * C(season)', bike).fit()

sm.stats.anova_lm(bike_lm)
```

-   The interaction between `workingday` and `season` seems to be significant towards predicting `cnt`

Talk with breakout group.

# 3

```{python}
casual_lm = smf.ols('casual ~ C(workingday) * C(season)', bike).fit()

sm.stats.anova_lm(casual_lm)
```

-   Not a significant interaction between `workingday` and `season` for casual bikers

```{python}
registered_lm = smf.ols('registered ~ C(workingday) * C(season)', bike).fit()

sm.stats.anova_lm(registered_lm)
```

-   Significant interaction between `workingday` and `season` for registered bikers

```{python}
unique_season = bike['season'].unique()

for season in unique_season:
    sliced_data = smf.ols("casual ~ C(workingday)", bike[bike["season"] == season]).fit()
    print(sm.stats.anova_lm(sliced_data))

for season in unique_season:
    sliced_data = smf.ols("registered ~ C(workingday)", bike[bike["season"] == season]).fit()
    print(sm.stats.anova_lm(sliced_data))
```

-   For each individual season, there is a significant difference between working days and non-working days in registered bikers
