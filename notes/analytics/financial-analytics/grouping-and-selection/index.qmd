# Variable Grouping

Scorecards eng up with only just groups within a variable.

**Objectives:**

-   Eliminate weak characteristics or those that do not conform to good business logic.
-   Group the strongest characteristics' attribute levels in order to produce a model in scorecard format.

In R, we have the `smbinning` package and in Python we have the `scorecard` or `OptBinning` packages.

**Goals:**

-   Useful for understanding relationships.
-   Modeling nonlinearities similar to decision trees.
-   Dealing with outliers contianed in the smallest / largest group.
-   Missing values tend to typically go in their own group.
