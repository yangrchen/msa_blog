In nonlinear optimization, the objective function and constraints are continuous but not all are linear.

Examples of nonlinear relationships:

-   $y = ax^b$
-   $z = axy$

Many algorithms use gradients to solve the optimization:

-   Conjugate gradient method
-   Newton method with line search
-   Trust region

The problem with gradient descent is that in cases with both local and global minima, there is no guarantee that a single run will produce the correct answer.

The best method is to try many different starting pointis to get an idea of how good our answer actually is.

# Portfolio Optimization

A **portfolio** is a collection of assets where the investor chooses the investment amount of each investment in the portfolio.

Portfolio performance is typpically measured by total value of the portfolio at the end of a period of time.

To determine how much to allocate in each part of a portfolio, two things must be considered--risk and return.

## Risk vs. Return

**Return** is the growth in value of an asset. **Risk** is the variability / volatility associated with the returns on the stock.

One way of estimating return is calculating the percentage growth:

$$
\frac{Recent - Previous}{Previous} \cdot 100
$$

-   In a portfolio we have numerous stocks, each with their own return, $r_1, r_2, r_3, \cdots, r_k$
-   Return of the whole portfolio will depend on the amount in each stock, $p_1, p_2, p_3, \cdots, p_k$

The return for the portfolio: $p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + \cdots + p_kr_k$

Risk of a portfolio is the variation. Individual assets have their own variability, $\sigma_{11}$ for variance of asset 1.

Using statistics, we define $Cov(aY_1 + bY_2):$

$$
Cov(aY_1 + bY_2) = a^2V(Y_1) + b^2V(Y_2) + 2abCov(Y_1, Y_2)
$$

We want to find $Cov(p_1r_1 + p_2r_2 + p_3r_3 + p_4r_4 + p_5r_5)$.
