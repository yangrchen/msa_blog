In **integer linear programming (ILP)** the objective function and constraints are linear but decision variables must be integers. In **mixed integer linear programming (MILP)** only some decision variables are restricted to integers.

Rounding with LP to solve ILP problems can sometimes produce suboptimal solutions. In order to move from LP to ILP problems we need to use a different algorithm: branch and cut.

```{python}
from gurobipy import Model, GRB

m = Model("Chairs")

c = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, ub=360, name="Chair")
d = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, ub=300, name="Desk")
t = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, ub=100, name="Table")

m.setObjective(15 * c + 24 * d + 18 * t, GRB.MAXIMIZE)
m.addConstr(4 * c + 6 * d + 2 * t <= 1850, "Fabrication")
m.addConstr(3 * c + 5 * d + 7 * t <= 2400, "Assembly")
m.addConstr(3 * c + 2 * d + 4 * t <= 1500, "Shipping")

m.optimize()

for v in m.getVars():
    print(f"{v.varName}: {v.x}")
```

# Binary Choice Models

**Binary choice models** are a form of ILP with a further restriction on variables to be binary (0, 1).

Two common binary choice models:

-   **Capital budget problem:** Companies that want to have projects within a given year but are only allocated budget to do a subset of these projects. How do we choose the most optimal subset of projects?
-   **Set covering problem:** Need to make sure an area is "covered" by available units. Example: How many EMS stations are needed to cover Metropolis City?

:::{.callout-caution}
In Gurobi, with binary choice models there can be a misleading "solution count 2" in the output. There is really only one.

## Set Covering

Metropolis City is divided into 9 districts and there are 7 potential sites for emergency vehicles. Sites can reach some districts, but not others, in the required 3 minutes response time. Location of these sites MUST cover all districts and we would like the have the least amount of sites that can accomplish this.

## Logical Relationships

Binary variables can also be used to model if-then-else situations.

Five common relationships:

-   At least $m$ items.
-   At most $n$ items.
-   Exactly $k$ items.
-   Mutually exclusive items.
-   Contingency based items.
