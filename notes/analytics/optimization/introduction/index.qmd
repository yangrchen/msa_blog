# Overview

In the mathematical sciences, optimization is trying to find the maximum or minimum a function can take. The goal is to find out what values of the "decision variables" (input variables) optimize the function.

## Terminology

-   **Decision variables:** Input variables in which we can change to optimize a function.
-   **Objective function:** Function in which we are trying to optimize. A function of the decision variables.
-   **Constraints:** Functions of the decision variables that define the constraints of the problems.
-   **Parameters:** Values inherent in the problem that we are not able to control.

## Outputs from an Optimization

-   No optimization exists.
-   More than one solution exists.
-   There exists one unique solution to the problem.
-   Other possibilities, but these are the most recognized.

## Types of Optmization Problems

1.  **Linear programming:** Objective function and constraints are linear.
2.  **Integer linear programming:** Objective function and constraints are linear, but decision variables MUST be integers.
3.  **Mixed integer linear programming:** Same as ILP but only some decision variables are restricted to integers.
4.  **Non-linear programming:** Objective functions and constraints are continuous, but not all are linear.

# Linear Programming

The **feasible region** is a region defined by our constraints. Think of this as the space of possible arrangements of our decision variables.

Easiest solutions for solving a linear programming problem is the **simplex method**.

## Example

Decision variables:

$$
x_1, x_2
$$

Objective function:

$$
2x_1 + 3x_2
$$

Constraints:

$$
0 \leq x_1 \leq 3
$$

$$
0 \leq x_2 \leq 3
$$

```{python}
from gurobipy import Model, GRB

# Create a new model
m = Model("mip1")

# Create variables
c = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS, lb=0, name="Desk")
d = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS, lb=0, name="Desk")
t = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.CONTINUOUS, lb=0, name="Table")

# Set objective
m.setObjective(15 * c + 24 * d + 18 * t, GRB.MAXIMIZE)

# Add constraints
m.addConstr(4 * c + 6 * d + 2 * t <= 1850, "c0")
m.addConstr(3 * c + 5 * d + 7 * t <= 2400, "c1")
m.addConstr(3 * c + 2 * d + 4 * t <= 1500, "c2")

m.addConstr(c <= 360, "c3")
m.addConstr(d <= 300, "c4")
m.addConstr(t <= 100, "c5")

m.optimize()

for v in m.getVars():
    print(f"{v.varName} {v.x}")
print(f"Obj: {m.objVal}")
