# Notation

-   AR(p) where p refers to the number of autoregressive terms
-   MA(q) where q refers to the number of moving average terms
-   ARMA(p, q) where p refers to AR terms and q refers to MA terms
-   ARIMA(p, d, q) where p refers to AR terms, d refers to number of differences taken (d = 2 means we took a difference of the differences), q refers to MA terms

# Autoregressive Models

Forecast a series based solely on the past values of $Y_t$.

We are focusing on the most basic case where there is only one lag value of $Y_t$--the AR(1) model.

$$
\begin{align*}
Y_t &= \omega + \phi Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \\
Y_{t-1} &= \omega + \phi Y_{t-2} + \epsilon_{t-1} \\
Y_{t-2} &= \omega + \phi Y_{t-3} + \epsilon_{t-2}
\end{align*}
$$

## Correlation Functions for AR(1)

ACF decreases exponentially as the number of lages increases. However, the PACF has a significant spike at the first lag, followed by nothing after.

The effect of shocks that happened long ago has little effect on the present IF the value for $|\phi| < 1$. Stationarity--the dependence of previous observations declines over time.

-   If $\phi = 1$, then we have a Random Walk and NOT AR model
-   If $\phi > 1$, then today depends on tomorrow which does not make sense

## AR(2) Model

A time series that is a linear function of 2 past values plus error is an AR process of order 2:

$$
Y_t = \omega + \phi_1Y_{t-1} + \phi_2Y_{t-2} + \epsilon_t
$$
