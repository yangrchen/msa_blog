# Regression with ARIMA Errors

External information can make better forecasts as well as potentially account for trend and seasonality.

We can incorporate predictor variables through a regression:

$$
Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{1,t} + \cdots + \beta_kX_{k,t} + Z_t
$$

We model the $Z_t$ error term with an ARIMA model. A regression with ARIMA(1, 0, 1) errors would have:

$$
Z_t = \omega + \phi_1Z_{t-1} + e_t + \theta_1e_{t-1}
$$

-   $e_t$ represents the white noise

# Intervention Variables

An **intervention variable** is an indicator variable that contains discrete values that flag the occurrence of an event affecting the response series:

-   Valentine's Day while selling chocolate
-   A special sales promotion raises sales

## Use Cases

-   Model and forecast the response series
-   Analyze the impact of the intervention

## Types

1.  Point / Pulse Interventions
2.  Step Interventions
3.  Ramp Interventions

## Point Interventions

In @fig-point-intervention we see a special sales promotion that occurs suddenly. How do we account for this? All we have to do is create a binary variable that indicates the intervention.

We model the impact through a coefficient in the model:

$$
Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1I_t + Z_t
$$

## Step Interventions

The idea of a step intervention is that we make a permanent step in our data and the change continues on from that time on. 

![Step Inteventions](images/step-intervention.png){#fig-step-intervention}

Any time period after the step is indicated by a 1 in the intervention variable. If we had multiple step events then we would have a variable for each one.

With intervention events, you need to have data prior to the intervention and after the intervention. Otherwise, you have no notion of change between the periods.

$$
Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1I_t + Z_t
$$
