# What kind of variables do you have?

Our variables are quantities or qualities of interest. These are also called:

-   Attributes
-   Features
-   Predictors/Targets
-   Factors
-   Inputs/Outputs
-   Covariates

## Quantiative Variables 

Quantitative variables have a quantity value associated with them. These are intervals, numerics or ratios.

-   Time
-   Temperature
-   Price

## Categorical Variables 

Categorical variables are inherently described by categories instead of quantities.

There are two types of categorical variables:

-   Nominal
    -   Soda, Milk, Tea
-   Ordinal
    -   Have logical orderings associated with them
    -   Small, Medium, Large

With ordinal variables, you can treat them as either nominal or quantitative. You have to make the decision.

Categorical Dummy Variables:

Small | Medium | Large
| :-: | :-: | :-:
1 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
0 | 0 | 1

The levels are given values if treated quantitatively:

Size | Size
:-: | :-:
S | 1
M | 2
L | 3

In addition, we also could do **optimal scaling** to represent the scale of the ordinal variables. This requires a careful definition of a "1-unit" change in the variable.

# Describing Distributions

-   Center/Location
-   Spread/Variation
-   Shape
-   Anomalous Observations

## Measures of Central Tendency

### Mean

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

### Median

Middle value. 50th percentile. Unaffected by outliers. In a right-skew, median is lower than the mean. In a left-skew, median is higher than the mean.

### Mode

Most frequent value. Typical for categorical data

## Measures of Location

**Percentiles** are a point, $x_p$, in your data for which $p\%$ of the data is $\leq x_p$.

**Quantiles** are the same thing as percentiles. The 10th percentile is the 0.10 quantile.

## Measures of Spread/Dispersion

**Range** is $\text{max}(data) - \text{min}(data)$

### Interquartile Range

IQR is the difference between third and first quartile. What is the range of the middle 50% of data.

### Variance $\sigma^2$ and Standard Deviation \sigma

Dispersion of the data around the mean. Average squared deviation from the mean. 

$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

-   The $n - 1$ comes from the degrees of freedom. In theory this will make this an unbiased estimator of the variance.

## Measure of Shape

### Modality

Modality is the number of humps a distribution has. A Normal distribution is unimodal.

### Skew

Is the distribution symmetric? Or does it have a longer tail on one side? 

![Left-skew and Right-skew](images/skew.png)

### Kurtosis

Does the distribution have thicker/thinner tails than a Normal distribution with same mean and variance?

A **leptokurtic** distribution has more data in the tails than a Normal distribution.

A **platykurtic** distribution has less data in the tails than a Normal distribution.

This only makes sense if you have a symmetric distribution.

## The Normal Distribution

A Normal distribution is a distribution that is

-   Symmetric
-   Fully defined by the mean and standard deviation
-   Bell-shaped / Unimodal
-   Mean = Median = Mode
-   Asymptotic to the x-axis (bounds are $-\infty$ and $\infty$)
-   Kurtosis = 3 (kurtosis often reported as *excess* kurtosis = kurtosis - 3)
-   Skew = 0 (there is no skew)


```{python}
#| code-fold: true
from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100)

mean = 0
sd = 1

y = norm.pdf(x, mean, sd)

plt.plot(x, y)
```

# Describing Distributions Part II

Using the **Ames Real Estate Data Set**, we want to try to predict housing sales prices in Iowa. We will also use `ggplot2` for visualization.

```{r}
library(AmesHousing)

ames <- make_ordinal_ames()
```

## Graphical Displays of Distributions

### Histograms

Each bar in the histogram represents a *group* of values (**bin**).

The height of the bar represents the frequency of percent of values in the bin. You can specify the number of width of the bins as desired.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ames, aes(x = Sale_Price / 1000)) +
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(y = after_stat(density)), alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2) +
    labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)")
```

The distribution is right-skewed so the mean is greater than the median housing price.

### Normal Probability Plots (QQ-Plots)

Used to compare two distributions, typically to verify that a variable is approx. Normal. 

Compare observed quantiles to theoretical quantiles of a Normal distribution with the same mean and variance.

If the points follow the line diagonal line, the distribution is Normal.

![QQ-Plot Problem Indicators](images/qq-plot-problems.png)

-   Quadratic patterns indicate problems with skew
-   Cubic patterns indicate problems with kurtosis

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(sample = Sale_Price / 1000)) +
    stat_qq() +
    stat_qq_line() +
    labs(x = "theoretical", y = "observed")
```

### Box Plots

![Box Plot](images/box-plot.png)

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(y = Sale_Price / 1000, x = Central_Air, fill = Central_Air)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(y = "Sales Price (Thousands $)", x = "Central Air") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
    theme_classic() +
    coord_flip()
```

## Defining Anomalous Observations

### Standard Deviations from the Mean

For symmetric distributions and particularly for the Normal distribution, it's common to consider observations more than 3 standard deviations from the mean as anomalous.

### Box-Plot Definition

Box plots define outliers as poitns that are $1.5 \times IQR$ above the third quartile or less than $1.5 \times IQR$ below the first quartile.

There are more definitions but these are the first couple we are considering now.
