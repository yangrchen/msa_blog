In analytics, fraud can be defined as uncommon, well-considered, imperceptibly conceals, time-evolving and often carefully organized crime which appears in many types of forms.

There are 5 main characteristics of fraud we can extract from this definition:

1.  Uncommon / rare
2.  Well considered and concealed
3.  Evolving over time
4.  Carefully organized
5.  Many forms

## Uncommon

Identifying fraud can be extremely difficult because fraud is a rare event.

-   5% or less target
-   Limited number of **known** fraud
-   Undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, etc.

## Well Considered / Concealed

-   In non-fraud data sets, observations are indifferent to be analyzed and discovered. 
-   In fraud data sets, observations are trying to not be analyzed of discovered--blending in.

## Evolving Over Time

Models have short shelf lives and must be adapted often.

## Carefully Organized

Fraud is often organized crime.

-   No independence
-   Copycat
-   Homophily: "Birds of a feather flock together."

## Many Forms

-   Fraud is ever changing and comes in a variety of forms.
-   The technology, economic, and social structures of today provide more and more opportunities for fraudulent activities to occur.

## Motivation

Pressure relates to someone being under circumstances that make them feel like they have to act on crimes to resolve something.

Opportunity comes in by being in a position where someone has access to committing fraud.

Rationalization relates to someone's ability to reason about why an opportunity can or should be acted on.

# Fraud Detection & Prevention

-   **Detection:** Observing **known** fraudulent observations to determine patterns that may assist in finding other fraudulent observations.
-   **Prevention:** Observing behavior and identifying suspicious actions that might be fraudulent--lead to further investigation and identification of new fraudulent observations.

## Fraud Maturity

New / young fraud analytics solutions are based on **business rules**.

IF:

-   Amount of claim above threshold OR
-   Severe accident, but no police report OR
-   Severe injury, but no doctor report

THEN:

-   Flag as suspicious AND
-   Alert SIU 

**Advantages:**

-   Simple
-   Easy to implement

**Disadvantages:**

-   Expensive
-   Difficult to maintain and manage
-   Fraudsters discover rules
-   Completely historical

# Analytical Fraud Solutions

Analytical solutions are typically used at the evidence of fraud stage. Our responsbility is to help identify potential cases that should be investigated--not to necesssarily catch fraud.

## Advantages

1.  Precision
    -   Increased detection power
    -   More information used in decisions
    -   More fraudsters investigated
2.  Efficiency in operations
    -   Automated processing of claims
    -   Ranked cases for investigators
3.  Efficiency in costs
    -   Cheaper in long-run to maintain
    -   Quicker identification
    -   Higher investigative returns

# Fraud Data

There are 3 common scenarios when it comes to fraud detection data:

1.  No previous data on fraudulent cases.
2.  Previous data on fraudulent cases, but can not use it.
    -   Organizational structure prohibits exchange of information.
    -   Retrieving data is too time consuming or expensive.
    -   Fraudulent transactions can not be mapped to master database of important information.      
3.  Previous data on fraudulent cases that is fully integrated into company databases and structure.

Even if fraud data exists, a majority of the fraud data has a typical value of "Unknown."

While a claim that has never been investigated is most likely not fraud compared to fraud, it is still impossible to correctly label.
