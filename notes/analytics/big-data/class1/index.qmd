# Current Trends in AI/ML

1.  Dynamic AI/ML Skill & Role Requirements
2.  Generative AI
3.  AutoML & Low-code ML
4.  Specialization

# Dynamic Skill Requirements

## Proprietary Software

-   SAS
-   Snowflake
-   Databricks
-   Dataiku

## Open Source Frameworks

-   TensorFlow
-   Apache Spark
-   Hive
-   LangChain
-   Kafka
-   Airflow

Don't need to build a perfect model. Goal is to get the data system integrated, deployed, and providing business value.

## Generative AI

-   Use it for Dev (with review)
-   Use it as an API (integrated into ML workflows and apps)
-   Experiment with frameworks, models, embeddings, etc.
-   Monitor emerging use cases
