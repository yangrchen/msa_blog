# Additional Linear Models Terminology

A **model** is a mathematical relationship between explanatory variables and response variables.

An **effect** is the expected change in response that occurs with a change in value of an explanatory variable.

-   The **main effect** is the effect of a single explanatory variable (e.g. $x_1, x_2, x_3$)

# Exploring the (Ames) Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(AmesHousing)

ames <- make_ordinal_ames()
set.seed(123)
ames <- ames |> mutate(id = row_number())
train <- ames |> sample_frac(0.7)
test <- anti_join(ames, train, by = "id")

dim(train)
dim(test)
```

```{r}
train %>%
    group_by(Heating_QC, Central_Air) %>%
    summarise(
        mean = mean(Sale_Price),
        sd = sd(Sale_Price),
        max = max(Sale_Price),
        min = min(Sale_Price)
    )
```

-   `Central_Air` seems to have an effect on `Sale_Price`

However, we always need to have statistical proof to back up any claims we make.

# Two-Way ANOVA Using Ames

With Two-Way ANOVA we are trying to see if the two variables are actually having a significant effect on explaining/predicting sale price.

$$
Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \varepsilon_{ijk}
$$

-   $\mu$ is the base level
-   $\alpha_i$ is the heating quality
-   $\beta_j$ is central air
-   $\varepsilon$ is unexplained error

```{r}
ames_aov2 <- aov(Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC + Central_Air, data = train)
summary(ames_aov2)
```

-   The individual p-values are telling us whether or not the variable has some significant effect on the response
-   If these two independent variables are completely independent then the p-values with just the one variable model would be the same

## Post-Hoc Testing

We have statistical differences among the categories and we want to know where these differences exist.

```{r tukey-hsd-plots}
tukey_ames2 <- TukeyHSD(ames_aov2)
print(tukey_ames2)
plot(tukey_ames2, las = 1)
```

-   `diff` refers to the average difference in `Sale_Price` between the two categories

Keep in mind that if you increase your sample size, **you should decrease your significance level**. P-values always go down with an increase in sample size.

# Two-Way ANOVA with Interactions

An **interaction effect** is when the effect of one variable changes as levels of another variables changes (e.g. $x_1x_2, x_1x_2x_3$).

Interaction does **not** mean that two variables are correlated with each other.

In an interaction term $x_1x_2$, changes in $x_2$ affect the relationship of $x_1$ to $y$ and vice versa.

![Interaction Interpretation](images/interactions_interpretation.png)

$$
Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + (\alpha\beta)_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ijk}
$$

## R Code

```{r}
ames_aov_int <- aov(Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC * Central_Air, data = train)
summary(ames_aov_int)
```

-   When you're looking at significance, make sure to look at the interaction's significance first.
    -   If interaction exists, we no longer care if the individual variables are significant or not because it's the interaction that matters.

## Model Hierarchy

Idea of **model hierarchy**: If higher-order terms are significant, then we should keep all the main effect terms that are a part of the higher-order terms as well.

## Slicing

If the interaction term was significant, the number of level pairs we would have to consider can be overwhelming. **Slicing** performs an F-test for means for one variable within the level of another variable.

An example is subsetting the data into `Central_Air`: Yes and `Central_Air`: No and then seeing the significance of `Heating_QC`:

```{r}
CA_aov <- train %>%
    group_by(Central_Air) %>%
    nest() %>%
    mutate(aov = map(data, ~ summary(aov(Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC, data = .x))))
print(CA_aov$aov)
```

## Assumptions

Same as One-Way ANOVA:

-   Independence of observations
-   Equality of variance
    -   Levene Test only available for interactions
-   Normality of categories
