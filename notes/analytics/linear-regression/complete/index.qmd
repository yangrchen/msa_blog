# Exploratory Data Analysis

-   Explore variables univariately
-   Anything that looks unusual?
-   Missing values?
-   Data types

```{r}
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(tidyverse)
data(FuelEconomy)

summary(cars2010)
```

# Multicollinearity

See if multicollinearity is an issue. If so, how do you 
want to deal with it?

```{r}
cor(cars2010[, c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14)])
```

- Going to remove `NumCyl` and `IntakeValvePerCyl` due
to high multicollinearity and other variables are more
correlated

```{r}
library(car)
cars2010.1 <- cars2010[, -c(2, 10)]
collin.test <- lm(FE ~ ., data = cars2010.1)
vif(collin.test)
```

-   Will also get rid of `Transmission`

```{r}
cars2010.1 %>%
    select(1) %>%
    head()
```
