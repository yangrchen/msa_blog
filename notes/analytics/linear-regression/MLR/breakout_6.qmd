# 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bike <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IAA-Faculty/statistical_foundations/master/bike.csv")

set.seed(123)
bike <- bike %>% mutate(id = row_number())
train <- bike %>% sample_frac(0.7)
test <- anti_join(bike, train, by = "id")
dim(train)
dim(test)
```

# 2

```{r}
bike_lm <- lm(cnt ~ temp + hum + windspeed, train)
summary(bike_lm)
```

-   $R_a^2 is 0.2487$
-   The variables `temp`, `hum` are significant at the 0.01 level

# 3

```{r}
bike_lm2 <- lm(cnt ~ atemp + hum + windspeed, train)
summary(bike_lm2)
```

-   $R_a^2$ is 0.25
-   `atemp`, `hum`, and `windspeed` are all significant at the 0.01 level

# 4

Our second model with `atemp` has a higher $R_a^2$ value.
