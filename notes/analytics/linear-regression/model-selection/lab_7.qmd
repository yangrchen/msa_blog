```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(FuelEconomy)

cars2010 <- cars2010 %>%
    mutate(across(!c(EngDispl, FE), as.factor))
```

# a
```{r}
full.model <- lm(FE ~ ., data = cars2010)
empty.model <- lm(FE ~ 1, data = cars2010)

for.model <- step(empty.model,
    scope = list(
        lower = empty.model,
        upper = full.model
    ), direction = "forward", k = qchisq(0.10, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
)
```

-   First variable added is `EngDispl`
-   Last variable added was `ExhaustValvesPerCyl`

# b
```{r}
step.model <- step(empty.model,
    scope = list(
        lower = empty.model,
        upper = full.model
    ), direction = "both", k = log(nrow(cars2010))
)
```

-   8 variables remain after stepwise
-   Did not get the same models between the two different methods. Stepwise had less
