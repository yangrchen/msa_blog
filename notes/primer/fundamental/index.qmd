There are three main pieces to statistics:

-   Data collection
-   Data analysis
-   Inference

# Data Collection

**Population**

-   Set of all objects (usually too large to obtain accurate info)
-   Example: The entire human population

**Sample**

-   Subset of population
-   **Sampling frame** is the actual list from which the sample is taken which may or may not equal the population

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 10
%%| fig-cap: Samples contained within population

graph LR;
    subgraph A[Population]
        B(Sample)
    end
```

Parameters are measures that we compute from the *population*. Statistics are computed from the *sample* and they are estimating population parameters (**point estimates**).

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Population] --> B[Sample]
    B --> C[Statistic]
    C --> D[Parameter]
    D --> A
```

# Sampling Techniques

 We need good sampling for good estimates and in sampling we incur **bias**.
 
 Bias is when certain outcomes are favored over other outcomes in samples.

## Common Types of Bias

-   Selection Bias
    -   Undercoverage: frame and population are not equal
    -   Nonresponse: subject in sample cannot / will not respond or be measured
-   Sampling Bias
    -   Convenience Sampling: selecting subjects based on accessibility and ease
    -   Voluntary sampling: subjects volunteer themselves--may not be representative

## Common Sampling Techniques

### Simple Random Sampling (SRS)

Sample items from population such that every possible sample of specified sizes has an equal chance of being selected

![Simple Random Sampling](images/simple-random-sampling.png)

**Advantages**

-   No statistical bias
-   No prev. info about sample needed ahead of time

**Disadvantages**

-   Expensive
-   Hard to implement
-   Need list of population

### Stratified Random Sampling (STS)

Population is divided into subgroups, called **strata**, so that each member in the population belongs to only one strata.

**Sample items from every strata**. The sample size between groups does not need to be the same (e.g. if we know groups in pop. are in a 20:80 ratio)

![Stratified Random Sampling](images/stratified-random-sampling.png)

**Advantages**

-   Smaller sample sizes can achieve same accuracy as SRS
-   More info about parts of population

**Disadvantages**

-   Need info about population ahead of time to split on

### Cluster Sampling

Similar to stratified where you group members of population into subgroups called **clusters**. You only talk to **a sample of $m$ clusters selected randomly**.

In cluster sampling, you don't necessarily believe there are differences between clusters.

![Cluster Sampling](images/cluster-sampling.png)

**Advantages**

-   Overcome issues with travel, time, expense
-   Easier to implement than SRS or STS

**Disadvantages**

-   Need info about population ahead of time to split on--but not total list.
-   May have slight bias if random clusters aren't representative

### Systematic Sampling

Select every $k^{th}$ item in the populatino after randomly selecting a starting point between 1 and $k$.

$k$ is determined as a ratio of population size over desired sample size.

**Advantages**

-   Very easy to get sample

**Disadvantages**

-   May be biased especialy if order of list of population matters

## Example

> A large worldwide financial company wnats to develop a new retirement plan for the company. They want to survey different managers of branches around the world to find out the most important strategies the new retirement plan should contain. They have 5000 branches worldwide and want to personally interview these branch managers. They have information about the banch size (small, medium, large) and the state/province location of the branch. They want to talk to 50 branch managers. 
>
> **Develop four separate strategies to sample these branch managers based on the four different statistical sampling techniques discussed previously.**

1.  SRS: Randomly sample 50 branches to interview the managers of
2.  STS: Stratify by size and select random samples from every strata
3.  Cluster: Randomly select sample of states/provinces, then select branches at random from those states/provinces
4.  Systematic: Select every 100th branch in list of branches starting from a random starting point between 1 and 100


```{python}
# Example of systematic sampling in Python

import numpy as np
indexes = np.arange(5000)
sample_size = 50
k = len(indexes) // sample_size

print(f'k: {k}')
print(f'Sample Size: {sample_size}')

start = np.random.randint(k + 1)
selected = indexes[start::k]

print(f'Length of selected: {len(selected)}')
indexes[start::k]
```

# Types of Data

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative

**Quantitative data** are numeric data that define value of quantity.

**Qualitative data** are data whose measurement scale is inherently categorical.

-   Nominal data are categories with no logical ordering
-   Ordinal data are categories with a logical order / only two ways to order the categories (binary *is* ordinal)

## Time Series vs. Cross-sectional

**Time series** is a set of ordered data values observed at successive point in times. Each row might be indexed by time referring to a dependence in time.

**Cross-sectional** is a set of data values observed at a fixed point in time or where time is of no significance (could have time as a variable just that the response does not depend on it).
