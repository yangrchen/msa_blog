## Import

Data comes from multiple sources:

-   Files
-   Databases
-   Web APIs

In the context of R, we are loading our data into a dataframe.

## Tidy

Store our data in a form that is consistent and allows us to focus on analyzing the problem rather than "fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions."

## Transform

If we have a problem we are trying to analyze, then we use our problem space to guide observations of interest or create new variables from existing variables that relate to our problem.

    Tidying --- C[ ]:::empty
    Transforming --- C

```

## Visualization and Model

We represent our data in graphs, charts, and other displays to help us find or resolve questions about our data.

"Models are complementary tools to visualization". Models help us answer the questions we have.

-   Every model makes assumptions and they cannot answer their own assumptions

## Communication

After the previous steps are at a satisfactory point, we have to communicate our results in a way that others can understand. This might mean in notebooks like this one or through presentations to a business client.

# What We Won't Learn Here

-   Modeling
-   Big data (book uses in-memory datasets)
-   Python, Julia, and other languages

The book focuses around the use of R, the `tidyverse` package and numerous packages in the R ecosysytem.
